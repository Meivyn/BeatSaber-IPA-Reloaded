BSIPA
=====

BSIPA is a mod loader based off of [Illusion Plugin Architecture](https://github.com/russianGecko/IPA-Reloaded), designed for Beat Saber.
While it retains backwards compatability, the recommended interface has been completely redesigned for a more consistent and stable installation.

Taking some inspiration from mod injectors like [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx), it uses a fork of [Unity Doorstop](https://github.com/NeighTools/UnityDoorstop)
to actually inject itself into the game.

****

The particular method of injection that BSIPA uses lets its user experience be far nicer than most others, not requiring a repatch for every game update.
